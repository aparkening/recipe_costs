# Recipe Costs

Professional kitchens need to know their recipe costs to profitably price their food. Recipe Costs makes it easy for chefs to figure out the cost-per-serving of their recipes.

**App Features**
- Users can log in directly or with their Google account.
- Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own recipes, ingredients, and categories.
- Recipe costs are calculated per recipe and per serving.
- Ingredient conversions are automatic. Recipe amounts entered as cups will seamlessly take advantage of costs entered as liters or gallons, for example.
- App-wide ingredients and default costs provide faster recipe creation, and users can customize ingredient prices for their own recipes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependences:
```
    $ bundle install
```
3. Create database structure:
```
    $ rails db:migrate
```
4. Run web server:
```
    $ rails s
```
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

Add your own data to get started. Or take the steps below to interact with a fully-populated app.

1. Run the seed file
```
    $ rails db:seed
```

2. While the seed file contains some ingredients to get started, you'll get more data by uploading the included ingredient CSV file.

a) Log in as the admin user, David Baker (with password `testing123`).
b) Navigate to /ingredients and upload the `ingredients.csv` file from app/assets.
c) Look at all that new ingredient data!

3. Log in as any of the seed users from /db/seeds.rb to add bulk ingredients to recipes via more CSV files. 

a) Log in with any default user, such as Paul Hollywood, Mary Berry, and Peter Reinhart (all with passwords `testing123`).
b) Navigate to /recipes and notice that there are recipes, but no ingredients or costs. Upload any CSV matching the user's name from app/assets.
c) Check out each fully-populated recipe!

## Development

In addition to the web interface, you can interact with the app via command line by using `rails c`.
